🛍 Amazon Front Page Clone | 🌐 HTML5 & CSS3
I created a responsive clone of Amazon’s front page using HTML5 and CSS3 🎨. This project showcases my front-end development skills by replicating the layout, design, and structure of one of the world’s biggest e-commerce platforms 🧑‍💻. I focused on building a clean user interface with proper HTML structure and modern CSS styling, including Flexbox and Grid for layout responsiveness 📱💻.
✨ Features:
✔ Hero section with promotional banners
✔ Product grid layout
✔ Responsive design
✔ Navigation bar & footer

Proud to share this as part of my portfolio! 🙌
